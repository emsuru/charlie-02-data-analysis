## üìñ Description

This Data Explorer is **phase 2** of a larger project where I develop an ML pipeline for property price prediction. See also:
- phase 1 (data collection) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-01-data-collection)
- phase 3 (ML model training) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-03-ML-model-development)
- phase 4 (API deployment) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-04-ML-deployment)  


## üå∫ Features

- univariate EDA (Jupyter notebook)
- multivariate EDA (Jupyter notebook)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Background & timeline

This project was done over the course of one week in February 2024 in Ghent (Belgium), during the AI Bootcamp by Becode.

Its main goals were to practice:

- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- data cleaning & preparation
- data visualisation
- data storytelling & presentation


The most challenging part for me with this project was coming to terms with just **how much** of EDA is iterative. Many were the times I had to go back to step 1 after discovering something in step 15.
To check out my exploratory work, open any of the three EDA Jupyter notebooks. 

## üöÄ Extensions

If I have time to return to this, I'd like to:

- use a better, clearer structure, where I split the investigation into structure, quality & content and for each section look at categorical variables and numerical variables separately and in a clear order (e.g. ordinal then nominal, discrete then continuous etc.)
- have a different version of the exploration where I try fancier libraries and dataviz tools (PyGWalker, Bokeh, Streamlit, Dash)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

All my code is currently heavily:

- docstringed
- commented
- and sometimes typed

This is to help me learn and to make my sessions with our training coach more efficient.
