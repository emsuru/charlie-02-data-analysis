## üìñ Description

This Data Explorer is phase 2 of a larger project where I develop an ML pipeline for property price prediction.

Have a look at phase 1 (data collection) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-01-data-collection) and phase 3 (ML model development) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-03-ML-model-development). 


## üå∫ Features

- univariate EDA (Jupyter notebook)
- multivariate EDA (Jupyter notebook)

## ‚è±Ô∏è Background & timeline

This project was done over the course of one week in February 2024 in Ghent (Belgium), during the AI Bootcamp by Becode.

Its main goals were to practice:

- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- data cleaning & preparation
- data visualisation
- data storytelling & presentation


The most challenging part for me with this project was coming to terms with just **how much** of EDA is iterative (it is commong to discover something at an advanced exploration phase that makes you return to step one).

To check out my exploratory work, open any of the three EDA Jupyter notebooks. 

## üöÄ Extensions

If I have time to return to this, I'd like to:

- use a better, clearer structure, where I split the investigation into structure, quality & content and for each section look at categorical variables and numerical variables separately and in a clear order (e.g. ordinal then nominal, discrete then continuous)
- have a different version of the exploration where I try fancier libraries and dataviz tools (PyGWalker, Bokeh, Streamlit, Dash)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

All my code is currently heavily:

- docstringed
- commented
- and sometimes typed

This is to help me learn and to make my sessions with our training coach more efficient.
