# Immo Charlie Phase 02: Data Analysis & Visualisation

## üìñ Description

This is the data analysis phase of a larger project to develop a machine learning model for price prediction.
Have a look at phase 1 (data collection) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-01-data-collection) and phase 3 (ML model development) [here](https://github.com/emsuru/charlie-03-ML-model-development). Phase 4 (deployment) is not yet started.

In phase 2 I have used the data collected in the previous phase to clean and explore. The result is in three separate notebooks.
Some of the most interesting dataviz graphs generated in the exploration were exported and included in a mock customer presentation. That slide deck is not included in this repo.

## üìÇ Project background & timeline

This project was done over the course of one week in February 2024.

Its main goals were to practice:

- exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- data cleaning
- data visualisation
- data presentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

All my code is currently heavily:

- docstringed
- commented

.. and sometimes typed.

This is to help me learn and to make my sessions with our training coach more efficient.
